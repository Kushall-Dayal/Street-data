This apsect tends to look on the bigger picture that is how the rules are being followed in general.We can see a significant trend that there are Less speed violations in the vicinty of red lights.There are speed violations in the outskirts of the city.And, northern part of the city is more prone to speed violations.

This visualisation was done by merging two data sets that included information on speed camera violations and red light violations.Then the violations of each type were mapped to see the effect of each others presence.Red circles depict speed cameras and Black triangles depict red light cameras.
