This apsect tends to look on the bigger picture that is how the rules are being followed in general.We can see a significant trend that there are less speed camera violations in the vicinty of red lights.There are speed violations in the outskirts of the city.And, northern part of the city is more prone to speed violations.

This visualisation was done by merging two data sets that included information on speed camera violations and red light violations.Then the violations of each type were mapped to see the effect of each others presence.Red circles depict speed cameras and Black triangles depict red light cameras.

This aspect hovers over the violations in each zipcode .
Interesting fact about this finding was that zipcodes:*60619,60623,60631,60636,60641* (marked in black) have had no violoations on the weekend !
The other colored cameras have had lower readings over the time, which is a good thing to consider .Other concerns regarding lower reading per zipcode was that there were lesser number of cameras installed in some areas, Zipcode:*60643,60642,60662,60645,60642* can have more cameras.
